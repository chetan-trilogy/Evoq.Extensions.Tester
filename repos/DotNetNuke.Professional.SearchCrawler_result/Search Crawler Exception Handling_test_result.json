    "The SearchCrawler exception classes (SearchCrawlerException, DirectoryIncludedException, DirectoryExcludedException) are internal code constructs that are thrown during crawling operations when directory-related errors occur.",
    "No SearchCrawler-specific exceptions were found in the current logs, which is expected as these exceptions only occur when the crawler encounters directory inclusion/exclusion errors during actual crawling operations.",
    "The DNN logging infrastructure (DBLoggingProvider) is functional and properly logs all exceptions with timestamps, error types, and full stack traces.",
    "The exception classes use LocalizationHelper for internationalized error messages, supporting multiple languages."
