    "The test environment is localhost (NOT an Azure environment), which limits the ability to test actual Azure-specific functionality such as: token storage in Azure environment, API calls from Azure-hosted site, Azure performance and scalability, and Azure-specific security requirements.",
    "The DNN manifest file explicitly declares <azureCompatible>true</azureCompatible>, indicating the connector has been designed and validated for Azure deployment.",
    "Code review confirms Azure-compatible patterns: database-backed settings via PortalController/HostController (not file-based storage), stateless HttpClient for API calls, and TokenCachedService for token management in multi-instance environments.",
    "The connector uses Evoq.Microservices.Framework for token management and service registry, which is designed for cloud environments.",
    "Initial navigation to localhost:8081 resulted in HTTP 500.19 error on a specific path (WindowsSignin.aspx), but navigating directly to Default.aspx resolved the issue - this is an IIS configuration issue unrelated to Azure compatibility.",
    "The Google Analytics 4 connector icon is missing in the UI (blank space where icon should appear), which is a minor UI issue but does not affect Azure compatibility."
