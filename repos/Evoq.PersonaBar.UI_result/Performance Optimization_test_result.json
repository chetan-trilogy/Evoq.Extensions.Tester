    "The task panel described in tasks.js (with 30-second auto-refresh) is intentionally hidden per CONTENT-8436 (evoq.js lines 100-102). Code comment states: '//hide task bar per CONTENT-8436'. This prevents direct UI testing of the task list lazy loading and 30-second refresh features.",
    "However, similar performance optimization patterns are visible elsewhere: the Scheduler shows tasks running with frequencies as low as 30 seconds (e.g., 'Every 30 Seconds' retry intervals).",
    "Knockout.js reactive updates are working throughout the PersonaBar - observable in search filtering, tab switching, and real-time server time updates.",
    "Lazy loading is implemented via pagination in the Users list (10 users per page) rather than infinite scroll.",
    "The caching infrastructure is well-established with multiple scheduled purge tasks for Module Cache, Output Cache, and Log Buffer."
